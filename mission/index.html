At the time, the Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in 1995 was said to have been the worst disaster in American history, with 168 deaths.

However, the disaster may pale in comparison to the enormity of the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot, where hundreds and perhaps thousands died.

The exact number of deaths will never be known. </p><p>However, as many as two thousand African-Americans were never accounted.

After the event, witnesses saw flatbed trucks with dead bodies piled on them. One man’s paid job was loading bodies in the back of his dump truck, then weighting them down and disposing of them in the Arkansas River.

This was to help minimize the actual number of people that had been killed during the race riot.

Mechelle Brown has been the program coordinator for the Greenwood Cultural Center for 19 years.</p><p> The center’s main purpose is to acknowledge the advancements of African-Americans in the Tulsa community, as well as provide educational and cultural experiences for children.

Eventually, the recognition of the history of the 1921 Race Riot and Black Wall Street became the centerpiece of the arts center.

“Blacks were not allowed to bury their own, they couldn’t have funerals. What were they doing with the bodies?”

“We know there were mass grave sites where they piled body on top of body and just burned them.” </p><p> The story had been suppressed by Tulsans and survivors alike for many decades. There are those who have sought to tell as much as possible, nearly 100 years later.

Race relations across the country were at a boiling point during that time.

Historic Greenwood, the site of the tragedy, was called “Black Wall Street,” by educator Booker T. Washington.

The area was affluent and prosperous, with thriving businesses and entrepreneurship.

The trigger for the riot was an alleged rape of a downtown elevator operator by an African-American shoeshiner, Dick Rowland.

The alleged victim was Sarah Page. According to reports, Page screamed when the elevator door opened and Rowland fled.

Rowland was arrested and jailed, while hundreds of whites gathered in protest. Eventually, as the crowd grew, it erupted into violence.

Whites set fire to and completely destroyed Black Wall Street, including 35 city blocks, along with thousands of homes and businesses.

The devastation resembled a war-zone, and could be characterized as an attempted genocide of Negro Tulsans. In the aftermath of the event, no whites were ever tried or convicted of the crimes. </p><p> Rebuilding of the Greenwood District proved to be long and difficult.

Brown has spoken to a number of the race riot survivors. In 1996, the center issued a plea for survivors to contact them.

They knew of 21 at the time. Through the plea, they were able to identify 160 throughout Oklahoma and the country. Today, there are only two who remain.

The survivors interviewed had vivid memories of the event. Most were hurt and devastated, not wanting to talk about or relive it. They had decided as a whole to put the memory behind them and move forward.</p><p> Brown emphasized, “You can’t talk about the story of the race riot without talking about Black Wall Street and you can’t talk about Black Wall Street without talking about the race riot.”

Many survivors did not  talk to their children or grandchildren about the disaster either. By the same token,  they did not tell them about their rich history as black entrepreneurs, home owners and business owners.

“One gentleman said he wanted his children to judge other people based on their character and not on the history of the race riot.” </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3d24a3072f4299db2d7cb30991f3db5d7d506fd3.png" alt="" title=""><p> The oldest living survivor for a long time was Otis Clark, who died a few years ago at 109 years of age. He was a teen-ager at the time of the riot. He recalled being shot at and hiding. 

He went on to become a minister and always began his talks with the events surrounding the riot. He would end his talks with a sermon about God’s love and forgiveness.

Eddie Faye Gates, a historian, is known to have interviewed every survivor. She was also appointed on the commission to study and issue an official report in 1997. </p><p> She recounts that Sarah Page worked with Sheriff McCullough to sneak Dick Rowland out of the Tulsa County Jail while the riot was happening.

Rowland then moved to Kansas City to live with friends of Page. Page was also known to originate from there. She never pressed charges and later moved back herself.

Gates has said they were lovers, but did not fully understand the racial climate in Tulsa. Page was more open to the relationship than Rowland. Others alleged Page did not ever scream, citing the fever-pitched racial climate as its own reason for the eruption. 
</p><p>Gates says Rowland later travelled and was eventually killed in a work-related accident in Seattle, but never returned again to Tulsa. As to what Brown would like people to know, she says, “It’s evident to me how cruel we can be. We’re often so judgmental of people across the world at how they treat each other of different races and religions. </p><p>But we have in fact shown we can be very cruel.”

“A lot of what happened in the race riot was calculated,” she says. “Some men went home, got their children and armed them to fight alongside them. They were told they could shoot a black person.”

Brown remembers the Ku Klux Klan in her own neighborhood as a child. “They came to my grandmother’s house in the middle of the night, just like something you would see in the movies. They had torches and white robes, looking to drag someone from her house.”

She continued, “They were in total control. There were no police that were going to show up and rescue whoever they were looking for.”</p><p><i><b>“It was terribly horrifying that your life or the life of someone you love could be in the hands of this mob of people who simply didn’t like you because of the color of your skin.”

“It hasn’t been that long ago. We are still experiencing the after effects of that hatred and resentment.”

Brown says her job is fulfilling. “How do you not acknowledge what happened or that those people ever lived?” </b></i></p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/57f5317257ce5100efbd6c9689dcde4b6c3e3b75.jpg" alt="" title=""><p> The loss of businesses, homes and lives during the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot was great. But more than anything, she wants people to know there is more to black history than slavery and the Civil Rights Era.

“We are a proud people; we were well-educated, highly skilled and savvy business owners. People in Black Wall Street took pleasure in getting their businesses started. They wanted to see one another succeed.”

Her work is to honor them; and to honor the history is to be able to tell the story. She talks with people all over the world, informing them about the race riot and Black Wall Street. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dee7cce7-fa96-4fd0-951b-e6c7f08ec084.jpg"><p> A list was compiled of all insurance claims from property damages. There were a total of $2.7 million in claims filed, but not a single one honored, due to the absence of a riot clause.

Brown points to the perseverance, courage, determination, ethics and hard work of the citizens of Black Wall Street. 

“What can we learn from them that we seem to have lost along the way?”

There are several thousand visitors to the center each year and Brown gives guided tours.She also speaks to people by phone, conducts radio interviews and speaks to youth groups.

The Greenwood Cultural Center is located at 322 N. Greenwood. Mechelle Brown can be reached by phone at <a href="tel:9185961020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">918-596-1020</a>, ext. 1026.

A television mini-series is currently in development on the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot, starring actress Octavia Spencer, for Oprah Winfrey’s OWN network.

Individuals involved in the production will be speaking at The John Hope Franklin Center Symposium on Reconciliation, Thurs., May 28.</p><p><a href="http://syftkogtech.tumblr.com/post/125736280671/be-self-controlled-and-alert-your-enemy-the" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">syftkogtech.tumblr.com/post/125736280671/be-self-controlled-and-alert-your-enemy-the</a></p><p> <a href="mailto:daviehodge@syftkogtech.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">daviehodge@syftkogtech.com</a></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="28"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/70f68f9d-5ea0-4115-ba7e-07a7bdd3c565.jpg" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="29"/></a><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="30"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="31">Mission :</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="34"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

In Jesus’ name, amen.</p></blockquote>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"49304c78-1e25-471c-a1a1-018a4c4c7f89","item":"3e0f4333-6355-425d-ac8b-36d6ff98ff69","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c26082c2952e35a54425417b450e50c4b1ce7095.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":"","inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","_caption":"","keywords":[],"coverPrefs":{"crop":true,"filter":true,"overlay":true}},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/aed2945daabd84e746f7fcb61843fb4f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fc26082c2952e35a54425417b450e50c4b1ce7095.jpg&width=350","original":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c26082c2952e35a54425417b450e50c4b1ce7095.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c26082c2952e35a54425417b450e50c4b1ce7095.jpg","ratio":"7:4","aspect":1.75,"orientation":"landscape","width":350,"height":200,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/aed2945daabd84e746f7fcb61843fb4f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fc26082c2952e35a54425417b450e50c4b1ce7095.jpg&width=350"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/aed2945daabd84e746f7fcb61843fb4f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fc26082c2952e35a54425417b450e50c4b1ce7095.jpg&width=350"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/aed2945daabd84e746f7fcb61843fb4f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fc26082c2952e35a54425417b450e50c4b1ce7095.jpg&width=350"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/aed2945daabd84e746f7fcb61843fb4f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fc26082c2952e35a54425417b450e50c4b1ce7095.jpg&width=350"}],"colors":[[0,0,0],[255,255,255],[88,88,88],[137,137,137],[190,190,190]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[23,23],[326,199]],"confidence":0.115085,"center":[179,106],"radius":168.026},"exif":{}}},{"id":"3823b577-56dc-4aae-9884-a9e05e85a2ae","item":"3e0f4333-6355-425d-ac8b-36d6ff98ff69","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":" Jim North, Southeast Campus Editor\nJune 1, 2015\nFiled under Showcase\n\nAt the time, the Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in 1995 was said to have been the worst disaster in American history, with 168 deaths.\n\nHowever, the disaster may pale in comparison to the enormity of the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot, where hundreds and perhaps thousands died.\n\nThe exact number of deaths will never be known. ","_html":"<p> Jim North, Southeast Campus Editor\nJune 1, 2015\nFiled under Showcase\n\nAt the time, the Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in 1995 was said to have been the worst disaster in American history, with 168 deaths.\n\nHowever, the disaster may pale in comparison to the enormity of the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot, where hundreds and perhaps thousands died.\n\nThe exact number of deaths will never be known. </p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"0495bfd2-5489-48f9-bd93-3af3f3ecb200","item":"3e0f4333-6355-425d-ac8b-36d6ff98ff69","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"However, as many as two thousand African-Americans were never accounted.\n\nAfter the event, witnesses saw flatbed trucks with dead bodies piled on them.

This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in\nhumanist and serif types.","links":["https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Slab","https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/roboto-slab"],"normal":4,"bold":7},"screen":{"normal":4,"bold":7,"$formality":-0.09090909090909094,"$type":["sans","grotesque"],"$caps":"normal","foundry":"google","family":"Roboto","name":"Roboto","license":"apache","tags":["sans serif"],"description":"Roboto is an open-source, grotesque sans-serif typeface designed by Christian Robertson in 2011 and released through Google.
