# Sarahah slurps up contacts 

Many social media apps sink their fangs into users' devices to
suck out their contact lists.

It makes sense. How else would they a) offer to hook you up with
people you know and/or b) [send
a swarm of marketing email][0] to pester your friends?

It's not only potentially useful; it has the potential to drive
your buddies insane with the resulting plague of marketing email, if
[LinkedIn's
past pestering][1] is any indication.

And now, there's a problem with the way that the latest viral
sensation app, Sarahah, siphons contact lists. Namely, it is quietly
sucking up users' contacts, but it's not giving them anything in
return.

Sarahah, the [latest
people-rating app,][2] bills itself as a way to "receive honest
feedback" from friends and employees... anonymously. How the
"anonymous" part of the equation jibes with showing users who
else they know on the app is anybody's guess.
