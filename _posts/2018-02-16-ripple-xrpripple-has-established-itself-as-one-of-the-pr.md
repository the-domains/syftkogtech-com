  Ripple (XRP)–Ripple
   has established itself as one of the primary cryptocurrencies to shape 
  the future of digital commerce. Following on the heels of the creation 

  of a 100 million USD hedge fund in XRP and the official lockup of 55 billion
  XRP
   in escrow, Ripple saw a 200% surge in price to 0.75 USD levels. Now, 
  with the backing of banks and other financial institutions, Ripple looks
   to make a strong case as the cryptocurrency of choice for an internet 
  commerce giant like Amazon.
