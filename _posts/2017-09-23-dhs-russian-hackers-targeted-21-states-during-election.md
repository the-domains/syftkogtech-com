  The Department of Homeland Security notified 21 states on Friday about 
  attempts from Russian governments hackers to breach their systems during
   the 2016 election. Among those that have confirmed that they were 
  targeted are Alabama, Washington, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Those four 
  states said that the breach attempts were unsuccessful. According to Politico,
   a DHS official said that only a few networks were successfully breached
   and none involved vote tallying. “DHS notified the Secretary of State 
  or other chief election officer in each state of any potential targeting
   we were aware of in their state leading up to the 2016 election,” DHS 
  spokesman Scott McConnell said.
