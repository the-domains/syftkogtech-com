  The Department of Homeland Security notified 21 states on Friday about
  attempts from Russian governments hackers to breach their systems during the
  2016 election. Among those that have confirmed that they were targeted are
  Alabama, Washington, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Those four states said that the
  breach attempts were unsuccessful. According to Politico, a DHS official said
  that only a few networks were successfully breached and none involved vote
  tallying. “DHS notified the Secretary of State or other chief election officer
  in each state of any potential targeting we were aware of in their state
  leading up to the 2016 election,” DHS spokesman Scott McConnell said.
