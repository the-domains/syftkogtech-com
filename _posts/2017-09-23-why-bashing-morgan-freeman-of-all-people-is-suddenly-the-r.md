# Why bashing Morgan Freeman, of all people, is suddenly the rage in Russia

The 80-year-old star's tenure in the business probably failed to prep him for the Russian reaction that greeted a two-minute online video he recorded recently for a group hoping to keep alive concerns over Kremlin meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Freeman is being portrayed as a tool of the U.S. establishment trying to bring down Trump, and as a man suffering from a "Messianic complex" from movie roles playing God and the president of the United States.

A "\#StopMorganLie" hashtag is circulating aimed at discrediting the actor.

In the controversial video's opening, Freeman dramatically declares: "We have been attacked. We are at war."

However the Department Of Homeland Security have solid evidence regarding the 2016 election

"DHS notified the Secretary of State or other chief election officer in each state of any potential targeting we were aware of in their state leading up to the 2016 election," DHS spokesman Scott McConnell said.

The Department of Homeland Security notified 21 states on Friday about attempts from Russian governments hackers to breach their systems during the 2016 election. Among those that have confirmed that they were targeted are Alabama, Washington, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Those four states said that the breach attempts were unsuccessful. According to _Politico_, a DHS official said that only a few networks were successfully breached and none involved vote tallying.

In addition to probing state election systems, U.S. officials say Russian hackers are responsible for stealing and strategically leaking internal documents from the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign in an effort to help elect President Donald Trump.
