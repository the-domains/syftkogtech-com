over phish; Security.txt standard proposed ]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c2583c74-97a8-4483-93d1-39e9dc32878e.png">,<h1>News in brief: Linux advice for Equifax; fired
over phish; Security.txt standard proposed </h1>,<p>
Would
SeLinux have stopped Equifax Breach ?</p>,<p>
Writing
on the Double Pulsar site, infosec practitioner&nbsp;Kevin Beaumont
suggests&nbsp;Security
Enhanced Linux (SELinux) would have saved Equifax&nbsp;from
the&nbsp;disastrous
breach&nbsp;it
disclosed earlier this month.</p>,<p>
If you’re going to have Apache Struts facing the internet, SELinux is
the way to go, he wrote, referring to the&nbsp;Apache
Struts vulnerability the thieves exploited:</p>,<p>“ <em>This is the #1 thing almost every organisation seems to miss.&nbsp;Security
Enhanced Linux is</em><em>very
simple to deploy — usually just one command — and it
beefs up security on processes. Correctly deployed, it stops Tomcat
accessing the system — so stops unknown exploits.”</em></p>,<p><em>~</em>by<em></em>Bill Brenner</p>,<p>The
article goes on to describe how the absence of SELinux makes things
easy for the bad guys, and how IT/infosec practitioners can get the
best bang from it.</p>,<h2>BBC: Finance director phished, then fired</h2>,<p>The BBC has a cautionary tale for pretty much everyone who uses
email. It’s the story of a finance director who was sacked after
falling for a phishing scam disguised as a message from the boss. The
name of the company and the players are anonymous in the story, but
the BBC describes the sequence of events this way:</p>,<p>The email from
the boss looked kosher. He said a new supplier needed paying urgently
– £50,000 to secure an important contract. He wanted it done as
soon as possible because he was on holiday and didn’t want to worry
anymore about work. This rang true to the finance director because
his boss had already posted a photo of his Greek island getaway on
Instagram. His email address looked genuine too. But, of course, it
wasn’t the boss.</p>,<p>It was a fraudster who’d done his research and was
skilled at psychological manipulation. The small manufacturing firm –
that wishes to remain anonymous – ended up losing £150,000 to the
fraudster in the mistaken belief that he was a legitimate supplier.
When the boss found out the bad news, he fired the finance director.</p>,<p>The article says to beware of three words in any email subject
field: “urgent”, “payment” and “request”.</p>,<h2>
Proposed
Security.txt standard resembles Robots.txt</h2>,<p>Security researcher and web developer Ed Foudil has an idea he
hopes the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) will go for:
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-foudil-securitytxt-00.txt">turning&nbsp;security.txt
into a standard</a>.&nbsp;security.txt is&nbsp;a file webmasters can
host on their domain root and use to describe the site’s security
policies. It’s a lot like&nbsp;robots.txt, a standard websites use
to communicate and define policies for web and search engine
crawlers.</p>,<p>The difference is that security.txt would be specific to security
policies.</p>,<p>In his paper,&nbsp;Foudil says the following:</p>,<p>When security risks in web services are discovered by
independent security researchers who understand the severity of the
risk, they often lack the channels to properly disclose them. As a
result, security issues may be left unreported. Security.txt defines
a standard to help organizations define the process for security
researchers to securely disclose security vulnerabilities.</p>,<p>According to Bleepingcomputer, it would <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/security-txt-standard-proposed-similar-to-robots-txt/">work
this way</a>:</p>,<ul><li>A security researcher finds a
	security vulnerability on a website 
	</li><li>He/she accesses the site’s security.txt file for
	information on how to contact the company and securely report the
	issue. 
	</li></ul>,<p>Security.txt is currently labelled as an “Internet Draft”, the
first IETF regulatory step in a three-stage process that also
includes&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments">RFC
(Request For Comment)</a>&nbsp;and official&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Standard">Internet
Standards</a>.</p>,<p><em><a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/09/19/">Catch

We are at war.”</p>,<p>However the Department Of Homeland Security have solid evidence regarding the 2016 election</p>,<p>“DHS notified the Secretary of State or other chief election officer in each state of any potential targeting we were aware of in their state leading up to the 2016 election,” DHS spokesman Scott McConnell said.</p>,<p>The Department of Homeland Security notified 21 states on Friday about attempts from Russian governments hackers to breach their systems during the 2016 election. Among those that have confirmed that they were targeted are Alabama, Washington, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Those four states said that the breach attempts were unsuccessful. According to <em>Politico</em>, a DHS official said that only a few networks were successfully breached and none involved vote tallying.</p>,<p>In addition to probing state election systems, U.S. officials say Russian hackers are responsible for stealing and strategically leaking internal documents from the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign in an effort to help elect President Donald Trump.</p>]]></description>

Email is Distributed]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1b339ee7-4d20-4513-86fa-06749d5905a3.jpg">,<h1>IRS Issues Ransomware Warning After Malicious Tax
Email is Distributed</h1>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7d431aa7-ab87-47e4-a621-d9ec44cb0f6d.png">,<h4>IRS Releases a Ransomware Warning to All
Taxpayers</h4>,<p>The IRS has issued a new ransomware warning to all taxpayers.
&nbsp;Cyber criminals have begun sending out malicious email
campaigns with a “message” from the IRS and FBI. &nbsp;According
to the email, tax payers must download a questionnaire regarding
changes to the laws regarding tax compliance. &nbsp;However, it is no
questionnaire at all. &nbsp;Instead, the user downloads ransomware.
&nbsp;Below you will see an example of the malicious correspondence:</p>,<p>IRS Commissioner,&nbsp;&nbsp;John Koskinen, made the following
statement to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2017/08/29/irs-issues-urgent-warning-about-ransomware-email-scam/#5104523861e3">Forbes</a>,</p>,<p>“People should stay vigilant against email scams that
try to impersonate the IRS and other agencies that try to lure you
into clicking a link or opening an attachment. &nbsp;People with a
tax issue won’t get their first contact from the IRS with a
threatening email or phone call.”</p>,<p>If you have already clicked to download the “questionnaire”,
do not pay the ransom demand. &nbsp;Paying the ransom is never a
guarantee you will get your data back, and it only reinforces the
criminal behavior. &nbsp;Instead, immediately report any ransomware
attempt or attack to the FBI at the Internet Crime Complaint
Center,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ic3.gov/">www.IC3.gov</a>.
You should also forward any IRS-themed scams to&nbsp;phishing@irs.gov.</p>]]></description>

</h1>,<p>Many social media apps sink their fangs into users’ devices to
suck out their contact lists.</p>,<p>It makes sense. How else would they a) offer to hook you up with
people you know and/or b) <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/10/05/linkedin-set-to-pay-13-million-compensation-over-its-email-persistence/">send
a swarm of marketing email</a>&nbsp;to pester your friends?</p>,<p>It’s not only potentially useful; it has the potential to drive
your buddies insane with the resulting plague of marketing email, if
<a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/09/24/linkedin-denies-charges-that-it-hacks-users-email/">LinkedIn’s
past pestering</a> is any indication.</p>,<p>And now, there’s a problem with the way that the latest viral
sensation app, Sarahah, siphons contact lists. Namely, it is quietly
sucking up users’ contacts, but it’s not giving them anything in
return.</p>,<p>Sarahah, the <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/08/11/latest-viral-sensation-app-sarahah-raises-concerns-about-cyberbullying/">latest
people-rating app,</a> bills itself as a way to “receive honest
feedback” from friends and employees… anonymously. How the
“anonymous” part of the equation jibes with showing users who
else they know on the app is anybody’s guess.</p>]]></description>
