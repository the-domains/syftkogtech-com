" alt="&ldquo;We understand Nelson Mandela is of Thembu (paternal) as well as Xhosa and Khoisan (maternal) ancestry.   So although not 100% Khoisan, his features tell us he is related to these ancient peoples. (Short, curly hair, small ears, &ldquo;copper&rdquo; coloured, and a gentle smile.)  Not only that, but his life is telling us the biggest story of a brave, dignified, heroic and noble life lived.  A stellar leader - such a rarity today. Now that this living legend is seeing the light of the horizon coming closer and before he &quot;goes over that horizon&quot;, we look at the amazing story he tells the Human Family. &ldquo;

~Henri van Bentum&#xFEFF;

Khoisan&quot; (/&#x2C8;k&#x254;&#x26A;s&#x251;&#x2D0;n/; also spelled&nbsp;Khoesaan,&nbsp;Khoesan&nbsp;or&nbsp;Khoe&ndash;San) is a unifying name for two groups of&nbsp;peoples&nbsp;of&nbsp;Southern Africa, who share physical and putative linguistic characteristics distinct from the&nbsp;Bantu&nbsp;majority of the region.[2]&nbsp;Culturally, the Khoisan are divided into the&nbsp;foraging&nbsp;San, or Bushmen, and the&nbsp;pastoral&nbsp;Khoi, or more specifically&nbsp;Khoikhoi,[3]&nbsp;previously known as Hottentots.

The San include the indigenous inhabitants of Southern Africa before the southward&nbsp;Bantu migrations&nbsp;from Central and East Africa reached their region, which led to the Bantu populations displacing the Khoi and San to become the predominant inhabitants of Southern Africa. The distinct origin of the Khoi is debated. Over time, some Khoi abandoned pastoralism and adopted the hunter-gatherer economy of the San, probably due to a drying climate, and are now considered San. Similarly, the Bantu&nbsp;Damara&nbsp;people who migrated south later abandoned agriculture and adopted the Khoi economy. Large Khoisan populations remain in several arid areas in the region, notably in the&nbsp;Kalahari Desert.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Surprising Way African-American Soldiers Were Recruited for World War I<br> Lily Rothman</strong></p>,<p>When the new PBS documentary series The Great War arrives this April to mark the 100-year anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War I on April 6, 1917, it will aim to tell the story of the American experience of the war, from the biggest moments to more obscure slices of history.<br> One of those slices is seen here, in the first exclusive clip released from the film, and it's a fitting reminder as Black History Month comes to a close of the obstacles faced and achievements recorded by African-Americans during that pivotal period of American history.<br> As the U.S. prepared to join in on a conflict that had previously been confined largely to the other side of the world, leaders within the African-American community in Harlem petitioned for the U.S. military to start a new regiment within the segregated armed forces so that black Americans could prove their strength and love of country just like their white fellow citizens could. The result was the African-American 15th National Guard — with the caveat that the unit had to raise its own money for equipment and serve under the command of a white officer.</p>,<p>Despite the conditions placed on the 15th National Guard (later re-designated the 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the "Harlem Hellfighters"), some of the biggest names around signed up, like bandleader James Reese Europe, who would help form the regimental band for the unit.<br> And, after the declaration of war came, the group saw record recruits — thanks in part to the unconventional recruiting technique is seen in this clip, using music to draw young men to the recruiting office.<br> Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter<br> TIME revisited the story in 1941 when the coming of World War II made the military band newly relevant:<br> Bandmaster of the 369 th for more than four years has been Russell Wooding, onetime Broadway arranger, and conductor, onetime bandmaster for the New York Giants football team. Bandmaster Wooding works his men hard, says: "All of us realize that we have a great tradition to uphold." That tradition was begun in World War I, when the 369 th was the crack 15th New York Infantry and its bandmaster was the late James Reese Europe.<br> In the early 1900s, when Northern popular musicians played only potted-palm tunes, big, black, Alabama-born Jim Europe held Negro jam sessions in a cafe in West 53rd Street. White folks dropped in, hired so many of Europe's friends to play "gigs" — single party dates — that Jim opened a booking office. He formed a Clef Club of Negro jazzmen, gave a concert at Carnegie Hall in 1911. He (at the piano) and his boys played for Vernon and Irene Castle. Once he excited the Castles' curiosity by playing Memphis Blues too slow for their brisk one-step. That, said Jim Europe and his friends, was how the fox trot started.<br> In 1917 Jim Europe and his manager, Noble Sissle (Shuffle Along), joined the 15th Regiment. The colonel made Europe band leader, raised $10,000 for instruments — 30 reeds, a dozen or so brasses, two bull fiddles (for concerts). Leader Europe became a lieutenant, Sissle his drum major and top sergeant. The two of them were soon putting riffs in conventional marches, had the band blare blues to a fare-thee-well. When the 15th reached France, Europe's band was detailed to play for U. S. soldiers just back from the front lines.<br> The three-part series The Great War premieres on April 10.</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJwlzUsOwiAQANCrkDlA0di6MKUbd95Ad3wGIQFphiETb6_RC7y35ki2opIcOBlYzgdQCfMzsYHTcQHVyRtIzHu_aC0i07sNHg4n36rG6jDo-X7Fm8X4qDOoH-caBSQDX8yW0iSOUronxNe26v-4fQDBOymp" height="244"></iframe>,<p>The Surprising Way African-American Soldiers Were Recruited for World War I Lily Rothman When the new PBS documentary series The Great War arrives this April to mark the 100-year anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War I on April 6, 1917, it will aim to tell the story of the American experience of the war, from the biggest moments to more obscure slices of history.</p>,<p>by syftkog on YouTube</p>,<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>]]></description>
